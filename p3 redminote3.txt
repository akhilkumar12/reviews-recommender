Body: Metal body feels and looks good, but is quite slippery maybe because of its curved edges.
Battery: Battery is way too good. It gave me averagely nine hours on screen time which included moderate gaming, heavy net surfing,
Camera: Camera is not bad as I read in other reviews. It clicks decent images for 12k phone. Focus processing is good, has real time filters. It is way too better than Le1s. (9/10)
Sensors: It has two more sensors than other phones. Fingerprint sensor work great like nine out of 10 times.

The phone is very lightweight. You wont feel that you are holding a device having very powerful battery.
Multitasking - As I have mentioned above, the SD650 makes multitasking smoother than anything. It is so fast when you switch one app to another.
Sound - Well, not like K4 note but much better than Letv Le 1S
Display - Very crisp, bright and sweet color reproduction.
Some cons of the device -
1. Average camera
2. Average fingerprint sensor
3. MIUI does not support fingerprint app lock and selfie capturing. However, Xiaomi has confirmed in the next update these features will come.
Some pros of the device -
1. Very good battery life.
2. Excellent performance.
3. Sweet UI
4. Very lightweight.
5. Sunlight and bright display.
6. Value for money :)

Bought it on 29.04.16 after so many failed attempts, week after week. But it is worth the wait! Don't need 2 go thru pros and cons about the device, everyone knows it. Xiaomi has hit d sweet spot between price and performance this time!
It just doesn't lag, doesn't matter whatever u throw at it. It's raw computing power processes each task with ease. Yes, there is a bit of frame drops while playing Nova 3, bt apart from that, every single hardcore games on playstore ran buttery smooth, atleast for me.
Display is bright n crisp, speaker is decent, sound via headphone jack is stupendous, build quality is top-notch though felt a bit slippery at times, performance is no match at this price-point, excellent is d word to describe it's processing power. IR blaster is a welcome addition, I would rate the camera performance as 'above average' with latest update, the video recording capability in 4k with Google camera app is awesome, so much clarity with full of eye-popping colours and detail.

Best mobile at this price range. I compare it with lot of mobile at this price range like, Lenovo Vibe K4 note, Le 1S, Huwai Honour 5X, but this mobile far much better than rest. I bought this mobile in in 4th May flash sell & using almost a week. Here are some pros & Cons I found.
Pros:
1. Excellent design & Shape
2. Display quality is awesome
3. As it has Snapdragon 650 hexacore processor, performance of device is really best

5. Most significant aspect is its battery, as it has massive 4050mAh battery it last for almost two days for average use once it fully charged.

7. Fingerprint sensor working good after Xiomi provide update for fingerprint scanner. Now I can lock my 3rd party apps & system apps with
using fingerprint scanner also you can click photos using same.
8. It provide MIUI 7 update which is good.
9. Device has IR blaster which is working well with almost all IR devices. So we can use device as a remote controller.
10. Call quality, Signal strength is awesome
11. MIUI provide high customization
Cons:
1. Slight heavy for use when we use back cover & screen guard otherwise good
2. device heats slightly while heavy use
3. Sound quality of speaker is not much louder but in headphone it is best

Phone is great and the quality is also good, battery life is awesome.Things i don't like flashlight which is little bit yellowish and camera quality which is fine in daylight and worst at night but again if you want a good camera than buy dslr.I will say it's full paisa vasool phone.heating little bit while charging which is normal and there is no over heating problem.1.5 gb ram is available and touch is responsive and there is not network or wifi problem, otg is working fine.24 gb space available.

Okay, so here is a honest review. Got this phone 3 days ago. Here is all you actually need to know.
The phone does heat but to a very bearable temperature. Being metal body I have no complaints with the heating. All those saying it heats, let me be clear. It only heats when running an tutu benchmark or playing a heavy game. And even then it's easily bearable. Battery is awesome. Display is rich. Sunlight display is not verryyy good but sometimes reflective. Camera is decent but awesome under good lighting conditions.
I made a call for approx 40mins and there was no heating or call drop issue even on reliance sim lol. Touch response is awesome. Performance in all areas is awesome. Also the ram management I found decent compared to previous miui versions.(ram management issues can be solved by flashing custom roms).
~
In short, the best phone for a budget under 15k. Excellent battery life, brilliant display, responsive touch, easy multitasking. I have faced no heating issues since i applied an update as soon as I got hold of the phone. Speakers have nice sound clarity although it gets muffled a bit if kept on a soft surface. Call quality is great. Only drawback that comes to mind is miui ram management couldve been better.
