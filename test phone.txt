Good phone.
Hardware is pretty awesome but cant say same for the software.
Had to flash cygenmod rom for better performance. Default Rom has lots of issues like connectivity issue, delay in showing screen when both sims are activated.

No reason to dislike it.. Good Camera, superb screen and back side of mobile is glass top that feels to good

Mobile is getting extremely heated.
Because of heating its getting slow down.
Also there is problem in catching good speed in case of WIFI network.
